Shasta aims for people to operate with energy in a simple and decentralized manner, which can empower any person to be a consumer and producer, through fair prices, marked by the people who are inside this network.\n\n\nThis platform will allow users to choose the source of their electricity, interact easily in the market and choose the lowest price without barriers or intermediaries.\n\n\nThe management of payments, receipts and all the detailed information to control the energy management is done through an intuitive user-friendly interface.\n\n\nCommunity channels\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReddit - \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/shastaproject/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter - \nhttps://twitter.com/ethshasta\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn - \nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/shastaproject/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpcoming events\n\n\n\n\nInside Blockchain by @holablockchain at ImaginCaf\u00e9 (Barcelona).
