## Why are we building Shasta?

At Shasta we believe energy freedom and establishing the foundations of the future of energy can allow individuals to move energy around the world in the easiest possible way.

Electricity and gas markets have created higher competitive markets and have caused price reductions by privatization. The history of the electric liberalization acknowledges that not everything in the world ended up well, and that there are still many obstacles to overcome.

Nowadays, the majority of the electric industry is in the hands of tyrants. Even in the most liberal countries, many citizens suffer from electricity poverty. What do we need to do to solve these problems? Give more power to the people.

## What is Shasta?
> A fundamental free energy market embedded into code.

Shasta is all you need to operate with energy, on the **Ethereum blockchain**.

Shasta is a web where suppliers and consumers can connect, building a new and unique energy network model through a **DAO** (Decentralized Autonomous Organization).

Built on **Ethereum**, a global blockchain for running unstoppable applications. Shasta aims for people to operate with energy in a simple and decentralized manner, which can empower any person to be a consumer and producer, through fair prices, marked by the people who are inside this network.

This platform will allow users to choose the source of their electricity, interact easily in the market and choose the lowest price without barriers or intermediaries.

The management of payments, receipts and all the detailed information to control the energy management is done through an intuitive user-friendly interface.
