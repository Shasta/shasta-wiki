## Why are we building Shasta?

At Shasta we believe in freedom and establishing the foundations of the future of blockchain can allow individuals to use crypto around the world in the easiest possible way.

## What is Shasta?
> A fundamental free market embedded into code.

Shasta is the new standard in blockchain, on the **Ethereum blockchain**.

With Shasta, you can now pay and request money with crypto to any business out there. Itâ€™s fast, safe, easy, and crypto-friendly!

We are working on a solution to enable everyone in the world to access the blockchain and buy their coffee, anything in a simple way.

Built on **Ethereum**, a global blockchain for running unstoppable applications. Shasta aims for people to operate with crypto in a simple and decentralized manner, which can empower any person to be a marketer or a consumer, through fair prices, marked by the people who are inside this network.

This platform will allow users to interact easily in the market and choose the lowest price without barriers or intermediaries.

The management of payments, receipts and all the detailed information is done through an intuitive user-friendly interface.
